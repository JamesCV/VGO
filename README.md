VGO Case Opening Site

Fully working VGO site and existing DB from current use of profiles that interacted with my site. 

The config file containing the Steam, OPskins and VGO API keys and a WAXExpressTradeID are excluded but can be replaced with your own. The API keys are free. They are required for functionality of the site. The client side file needs the socket to connect to the relevant URL.

Site is built in Javascript, CSS, HTML from the ground up including case opening functionality, inventory loading, onsite chat for users, showcase and stats of skins unboxed by the user already, top skins unboxed on the site, latest skins unboxed and also includes affiliates for users.

198 Cases opened @ $2.5 each. $495 of cases consumed by users on my site.
$313 worth of cases unboxed.
103 Users registered on my site.

#### Index page displaying the webchat for the users, live stats for the site, all the VGO cases to unbox and the Live/Top skins unboxed sidebar.

#### Case opening page displaying the UI for the user opening a case. Intuitive for the user to open a case, a trade offer notification is displayed and the spinner rolls the items.
