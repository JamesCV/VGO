# VGO
case opening site

Fully working VGO site and existing DB from current use of profiles that interacted with my site. The config file containing the
Steam, OPskins and VGO API keys and a WAXExpressTradeID are excluded but can be replaced with your own. The API keys are free. They are 
required for functionality of the site.

Site is built in Javascript, CSS, HTML from the ground up including case opening functionality, inventory loading, onsite chat for users
and affiliates for users.

VGOUpgrade.
